**Key Features**

Very simple application where users can order one or more pizzas from a menu

No user accounts or login required — users just input their names before using the app

Pizza menu is dynamic and loaded from an API

Users can add multiple pizzas to a cart before ordering

Ordering requires only the user's name, phone number, and address

GPS location can be added to make delivery easier

Users can mark their order as priority, adding 20% to the total price

Orders are submitted via a POST request with user and pizza data

Payments are made on delivery — no payment processing required

Each order receives a unique ID so users can check order status later

Users can still set an existing order as priority after placing it


**Built With**

React

Redux Toolkit

Tailwind CSS

Mobile-first workflow

Vite


What I Learned

During this project, I improved my Tailwind CSS skills, learned how to work with React Router and thunks, and used Redux Toolkit effectively for state management. These experiences strengthened my understanding of scalable React application architecture.
